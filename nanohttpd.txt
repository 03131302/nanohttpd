NanoHTTPD
=========

Why another Java HTTPD?
-----------------------

I couldn't find a small enough, embeddable and easily modifiable HTTP server
that I could just copy and paste into my other Java projects. Every one of them
consisted of dozens of .java files and/or jars, usually with - from my point
of view - "overkill features" like servlet support, web administration,
configuration files, logging etc.

So I made my own. Take it, hopefully you'll find it useful, too.

Features & limitations
----------------------

* Only one Java file
* Java 1.1 compatible
* Released as open source, Modified BSD licence
* No fixed config files, logging, authorization etc.
  (Implement by yourself if you need them.)
* Supports parameter parsing of GET and POST methods  (+ rudimentary PUT support in 1.25)
* Parameter names must be unique. (Adding support to multiple instance of a parameter is not difficult, but would make the interface a bit more cumbersome to use.)
* Supports both dynamic content and file serving
* Supports file upload (since version 1.2, 2010)
* Never caches anything
* Doesn't limit bandwidth, request time or simultaneous connections
* Default code serves files and shows all HTTP parameters and headers
* File server supports directory listing, ``index.html`` and ``index.htm``
* File server supports partial content (streaming)
* File server supports ETags
* File server does the 301 redirection trick for directories without ``/``
* File server supports simple skipping for files (continue download)
* File server serves also very long files without memory overhead
* Contains a built-in list of most common mime types
* All header names are converted lowercase so they don't vary between browsers/clients

Ways to use
-----------

* Run as a standalone app (serves files from current directory and shows requests)
* Subclass serve() and embed to your own program (see `HelloServer.java <http://github.com/elonen/nanohttpd/blob/master/HelloServer.java>`_ for a simple example)
* Call serveFile() from serve() with your own base directory
* To test file uploading, try browsing `file-upload-test.htm <http://github.com/elonen/nanohttpd/blob/master/file-upload-test.htm>`_ through NanoHTTPD, upload something and watch the console output

Java 1.6 version
----------------

If need, for example, support for large uploads on Android and don't mind running
Java 6, you might also want to take a look at Paul Hawke's fork at http://github.com/psh/nanohttpd
